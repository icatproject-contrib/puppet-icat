>>>This is a string against which we will test.<<<

This is a parameter against which we will test:
<%= $param %>

If we want to be really strict (in the absence of being able to get parameter tags to work properly),
then we can validate just as we would in a Puppet class:
<%= validate_string($param1) %>
